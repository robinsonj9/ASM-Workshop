## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Practice with R Markdown

## In RStudio open a new R Markdown file

## Modify the YAML – title, name, date

## Remove existing comments and code chunks

## Add the following elements to your R Markdown with headers and appropriate comments for each section and following coding best practices
 * Personal info: name, pronouns, email (included as link), and why you chose this workshop 
 * Insert a fun image of your choice and resize it  
 * A code chunk that won’t be run when knit that installs packages (tidyverse, )  
 * Code chunk that won’t display messages when knit that loads the installed libraries  
 * Read in data in tidy format  
 * Explore the data a bit using functions you're familiar with,  *or if new to R use online resources to look up some functions that provide information about a data frame*  
 * Generate a plot with the data *this can be as simple or advanced as you want*  
 * Do some data manipulation and save the new data to your environment AND to the data folder *this can be as simple as rearranging the row or column order or more advance*  
 * Knit your .rmd file as a .html and .pdf *some systems may require additional software installed to knit as a pdf or word document, let us know if you run into issues and we can provide assistance to get you setup with the correct software for future coding*
